# HEMat

HEMat is a software package for performing a secure outsourced matrix computation using homomorphic encryption (https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3243837). 

## Setting up HEMat library 

HEMat is easy to configure and build in Linux and macOS. 

Clone this Github repository into a directory of your choice:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/K-miran/HEMat
```

### Dependencies

Our library requires a c++ compiler and the following libraries:

* `GMP` (GNU Multi-Precision library, >= 6.1.2), which is available at https://gmplib.org,

* `NTL`  (>=11.0.0), which is available at http://www.shoup.net/ntl/,  (with pThread)

* `HEAAN`,  which is an implementation of the paper "Homomorphic Encryption for Arithmetic of Approximate Numbers" (https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/421.pdf). We refered to the underlying HE library in the "src" folder. You can build the libarary â€œlibheaan.a" by typing "$make all" in the "/HEAAN" directory.


### Installing HEMat library

First, compile the dependency -- HEAAN library
```sh
cd HEMat/HEAAN/
make all
```

You can then install our library by the following work with command line tools in the "/HEMat" directory. :

```sh
cd HEMat/HEMat
make new
```

This will build our library "libHEMat.a".  

## Running a test source code

The program will run with several secure matrix algorithms (e.g. matrix addition, multiplication, transposition, and rectangular matrix multiplication).  
For example, you run a test program in the the directory by doing as follows: 

```sh
make test
./foo 
```
